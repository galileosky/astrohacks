The first line contains the latitude and longitude of the observing 
site, in degrees (North and West are positive).

The second line contains the uncertainties in the Right Ascension and
Declination directions, respectively.

The rest of the file contains the observation data. One 
observation per line.

First, the expected Right Ascension and Declination.
Then the measured Right Ascension and Declination from the telescope.

These values are in degrees.
